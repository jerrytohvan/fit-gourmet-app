## Initialising Project
#### MAC
1. `git clone` the project to your local environment. It is recommended to keep the folder name as Github's clone for easy pre-configuration.
2. Using command line and terminal, move to cloned folder directory `cd fit-gourmet-app`
3. Initialise folder packages by running `yarn install` or simply `yarn`. Wait until packages are installed properly.
4. To execute programme locally run `expo start`.
5. Browser should be automatically open for you to run local Expo client. Otherwise, open the automatic [generated localhost](http://localhost:19000/). It could be at `http://localhost:19000/`, `http://localhost:19001/` or `http://localhost:19002/`.
6. You may run iOS simulator (after XCode is pre-installed) or run android simulator with your Android device connected to your computer (Debug privileges are required) alternatively the Android SDK is required to run Android Simulator.
